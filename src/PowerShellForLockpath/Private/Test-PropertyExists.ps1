function Test-PropertyExists {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Determines if an object contains a property with a specified name.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Determines if an object contains a property with a specified name.

        This is essentially using Get-Member to verify that a property exists,
        but additionally adds a check to ensure that InputObject isn't null.

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        The object to check to see if it has a property named Name.

    .PARAMETER Name
        The name of the property on InputObject that is being tested for.

    .EXAMPLE
        Test-PropertyExists -InputObject $listing -Name 'title'

        Returns $true if $listing is non-null and has a property named 'title'.
        Returns $false otherwise.

    .NOTES
        Internal-only helper method.
