function Write-Log {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Writes logging information to screen and log file simultaneously.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Writes logging information to screen and log file simultaneously.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER Message
        The message(s) to be logged. Each element of the array will be written to a separate line.

        This parameter supports pipelining but there are no
        performance benefits to doing so. For more information, see the .NOTES for this
        cmdlet.

    .PARAMETER Level
        The type of message to be logged.

    .PARAMETER Indent
        The number of spaces to indent the line in the log file.

    .PARAMETER Path
        The log file path.
        Defaults to $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShellForGitHub.log

    .PARAMETER Exception
        If present, the exception information will be logged after the messages provided.
        The actual string that is logged is obtained by passing this object to Out-String.

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-Log -Message "Everything worked." -Path C:\Debug.log

        Writes the message "Everything worked." to the screen as well as to a log file at "c:\Debug.log",
        with the caller's username and a date/time stamp prepended to the message.

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-Log -Message ("Everything worked.", "No cause for alarm.") -Path C:\Debug.log

        Writes the following message to the screen as well as to a log file at "c:\Debug.log",
        with the caller's username and a date/time stamp prepended to the message:

        Everything worked.
        No cause for alarm.

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-Log -Message "There may be a problem..." -Level Warning -Indent 2

        Writes the message "There may be a problem..." to the warning pipeline indented two spaces,
        as well as to the default log file with the caller's username and a date/time stamp
        prepended to the message.

    .EXAMPLE
        try { $null.Do() }
        catch { Write-Log -Message ("There was a problem.", "Here is the exception information:") -Exception $_ -Level Error }

        Logs the message:

        Write-Log : 2018-01-23 12:57:37 : dabelc : There was a problem.
        Here is the exception information:
        You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.
        At line:1 char:7
        + try { $null.Do() } catch { Write-Log -Message ("There was a problem." ...
        +       ~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], RuntimeException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeMethodOnNull

    .INPUTS
        System.String

    .NOTES
        The "LogPath" configuration value indicates where the log file will be created.
        The "" determines if log entries will be made to the log file.
           If $false, log entries will ONLY go to the relevant output pipeline.

        Note that, although this function supports pipeline input to the -Message parameter,
        there is NO performance benefit to using the pipeline. This is because the pipeline
        input is simply accumulated and not acted upon until all input has been received.
        This behavior is intentional, in order for a statement like:
            "Multiple", "messages" | Write-Log -Exception $ex -Level Error
        to make sense.  In this case, the cmdlet should accumulate the messages and, at the end,
        include the exception information.
